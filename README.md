This module is under active development.

Synopsis

      # let's filter all the requests to our backend API s(i.e. a tornado web app)
      location ~* \.do$ {

         # enable the apikey access filter
         apikey_access_filter on;

         # set the connection string for the client_id / client_secret provider
         apikey_access_filter_dburl "mysql://apikeyadmin:apikeyadmin@127.0.0.1:3306/APIKEYS";

         # common reverse proxy config (i.e. for tornado)

Description
===========

This module could be useful to anyone who develops backends APIs wich are consumed by Javascript, iOS, Android and other client apps.Rather then implements access controls for each backend, you can enble this filter at the relative location in your nginx configuration file.

Every time a client app call one of yours backend API, it has to pass a token (named `X-AuthAPI`):

    client_id|issued_time|HAMAC_SHA1(client_id|request_uri_path, client_secret)

Where `client_id` and `client_secret` are strings generated as you desire. The `client_secret` will be kept safe in your own database.

Each client application that have to call your API has the `client_id` and a`client_secret`; when issue the request, has to pass this token. The token can be passed as Request Header or as Cookie, the module will check cookies first and then request headers.

Here an example. The client application has:

    client_id     = LUCACLIENTID1971
    client_secret = MyCl13n7S3Cr377001233aaER

and wants to call the backend API `http://your.cool.domain.com/get_all_photos.do?q=cat&max_results=40`; let's suppose that the `issued_time = 1335104889` in unix epoch time, so the token will be:

    LUCACLIENTID1971|1335104889|f0679855e23b2c338a41491c0b8e0576cc8397dd

Here the http request using wget:

     wget --header="X-AuthAPI:LUCACLIENTID1971|1335104889|f0679855e23b2c338a41491c0b8e0576cc8397dd" \
         -O - "http://your.cool.domain.com/get_all_photos.do?q=cat&max_results=40"

If the token is invalid (tampered, expired etc.) this module will repond with an ERROR 403: Forbidden
